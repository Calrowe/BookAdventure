	<p>You manage to escape the battle with a few others of you mates. After 
	<br>reaching the boats you throw yourself onboard of one of them and rows out 
	<br>into the sea. After one day adrift another raid of vikings spots you and 
	<br>boards your boat. Only a hanful of men against dozens the make the battle
	<br>swift and throws your lifeless bodies into the sea. And no Valhalla awaits
	<br>the cowards who deserted their comrades.

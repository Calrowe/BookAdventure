		<p>You are the fierce viking warrior Brynolf, son of Ulfrick, and you
		<br>are on one of many boats raiding the coasts of England. You jump
		<br>ashore with you your fellow mates at yet another monastery that 
		<br>looks like an easy raid. You first walk towards it and after they
		<br>noticed you and their bells start to chime you all start to run with
		<br>with a roar of combat. 
		<br>Halfway there arrows from the forest nearby starts to rain down on you
		<br>and your chieftain yells:
		<br>"Quick! Change course towards the forest! Shields in front!
